## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project presents an **AI-driven diagnostic system** for prenatal care that leverages 
**Deep Learning (MobileNetV2)** and **Image Processing (OpenCV)** to detect 
**fetal growth abnormalities** and analyze **amniotic fluid levels** from X-ray and ultrasound images.

Abnormal fluid levels, such as **oligohydramnios** (too little) or **polyhydramnios** (too much), 
can signal severe complications. Traditional ultrasound methods rely heavily on expert interpretation, 
which is **time-consuming and error-prone**.

### ðŸš€ Our system automates this process by:
- ðŸ“· Preprocessing medical images to remove noise and highlight key regions.  
- ðŸ¤– Classifying fetal growth patterns using **MobileNetV2 CNN**.  
- ðŸ’§ Detecting amniotic fluid levels with **OpenCV techniques**.  
- ðŸ“Š Providing **real-time results with confidence scores**.
